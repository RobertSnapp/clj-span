* Introduction and Problem Statement
** Difficulties in modelling and quantifying Ecosystem Services
** Data Gaps
*** Patchy
*** Missing
*** Outdated
*** Untrustworthy
** Model Credibility
*** Communicating and visualizing uncertainty
*** Transparency and avoiding the "black box" label
* Methods
** Service Path Attribution Networks
*** Spatially connecting ecosystem service producers to their human beneficiaries via simulation
*** Source, Sink, Use, Flow (inc. Topography) components
*** Limitations of the current SPAN formalism (deterministic, not robust against data gaps, doesn't communicate uncertainty)
** Bayesian Belief Networks
*** Replace Source, Sink, Use, and Topography functions
*** Training on complete data sets enables function transfer to patchy regions
*** Expert-provided priors addresses missing information
** Trust Management
*** Outdated or untrustworthy data can be made more robust by applying CPTs as transition functions from labeled state to true state
    - For an RV with states in {A,B,C} and mapped value A, replace A with CPT, such that P(A|A) + P(B|A) + P(C|A) = 1
    - For an RV with states in R (reals) and mapped value r, select sigma (stdev) and replace r with N(r,sigma) <-- normal assumption (good idea, bad idea?)
*** Distributions generated in this way can be set as evidence on Source, Sink, Use, and Topography BNs.
** Uncertainty Propagation
*** Rewrite SPAN formulas with RVs
*** Describe varprop and randvar RV representations and the operations defined on them
*** RV dependence issues!
*** Monte carlo simulation and mean field approximation as uncertainty simulation techniques
** Case Study Example
*** Possibly run a viewshed analysis deterministically and with stochastic improvements 
* Results
** Discuss differences in results between deterministic and stochastic runs
** Show Source, Sink, Use, Topography, and Flow uncertainties
** Visualize uncertainty using alpha channel, secondary mask, and 3d plot
* Discussion
** Robustness against data gaps
** Discuss intuitiveness of results and their associated uncertainties using this approach
** Is this potentially more useful both for modellers and decision makers?
* Conclusion
** Reiterate benefits of this approach
** Future research directions (RV dependence?, scaling and polygon-based flows, incorporating spatio-temporal BNs)
